# week4-BCLN-project

# Points to keep in mind from our previous SGCs
- Make co-authored commits
- Switch pairs every hour 
- Update READme as we go 
- no working after 6 
- take 5 minutes in the day to think about our roles and what needs to be achieved 
- make sure everyone understands all of the code
